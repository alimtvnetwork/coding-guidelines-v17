"""Audit-trail schema validation — every row must carry a `reason`,
and every `ignored-deleted` row's reason must come from the closed
shared vocabulary in `audit_reason_vocab`.

The placeholder linter promises two contracts on its
`--list-changed-files` audit output:

1. **Universal `reason` field.** Every row, regardless of `status`,
   carries a non-empty string `reason`. This is the operator's
   one-line explanation of *why* the path landed in this row's
   bucket, and CI dashboards rely on it being present so they don't
   need a per-status branch just to render a tooltip.

2. **Closed `ignored-deleted` vocabulary.** When `status ==
   "ignored-deleted"`, the row's `reason` must be one of the texts
   produced by `audit_reason_vocab.resolve_deleted_reason()` for a
   tag in `DELETED_SOURCES` — i.e. either a flat template
   (`diff-D`, `changed-files-D`) or a `{new_path}`-substituted
   template (`*-R-old`, `*-C-old`). Free-form reason strings on
   deleted rows would defeat the single-source-of-truth invariant
   the shared vocab module is designed to enforce.

The fallback message (`DELETED_REASON_FALLBACK`) is *intentionally*
treated as a contract violation here: it's a runtime safety net for
parser drift, not a value the shipped linter should ever emit on a
clean payload. A test failure on the fallback means a parser is
producing a tag the vocabulary doesn't know about — exactly the
drift these tests are designed to catch.

Both contracts are validated across all three audit surfaces:
JSON (via `--json`), CSV (via `--similarity-csv -`), and the
plain-text table (parsed loosely by extracting the trailing
reason cell of each row). Each surface runs against the same
fixture so a discrepancy across formats is also caught.
